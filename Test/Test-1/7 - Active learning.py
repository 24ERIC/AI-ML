'''
- special case of ML
- interactively query a user - information source - label new data points 
- optimal experimental design.
- unlabeled data is abundant but manual labeling is expensive.
- supervised learning
- the number of examples to learn - lower
- risk - overwhelmed by uninformative examples.
- multi-label active learning
- Membership Query Synthesis
- Pool-Based Sampling
- Stream-Based Selective Sampling
- Query strategies
- Minimum marginal hyperplane
